## Hangman

I created a simple well known word guessing game called hangman. It was designed to show some basic python knowledge with the interface being the python terminal. The user will try and guess a randomely selected word by inputting one letter at a time which will either reveal the word or lead to a loss if the word was not guessed. The player will have 6 chances and the game includes 2 game modes which are easy and hardcore. The easy gamemode will display some random letters which in turn will help the player guess the word.
