## Hangman

I created a simple well known word guessing game called hangman. It was designed to show some basic python knowledge with the interface being the python terminal. The user will try and guess a randomely selected word by inputting one letter at a time which will either reveal the word or lead to a loss if the word was not guessed. The player will have 6 chances and the game includes 2 game modes which are easy and hardcore. The easy gamemode will display some random letters which in turn will help the player guess the word.

# How to play

- The User will enter there name which will then take them to a options menu with the options being Easy mode, Hardcore mode, and How to play.
- The User will then choose a letter if the letter is part of the word then it will fill in the space where it belongs in the word.
- If the letter that is chosen is not part of the word then one of the 6 moves the player has is lost and the hangman animation will progress
- If the user selects 6 wrong letters then its game over 
- If the user selects the easy game mode then some of the letters in the word will already be visible.
- If hardcore mode is selected then no hints will be given.
